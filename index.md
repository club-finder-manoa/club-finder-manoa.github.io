## **Overview**
<!-- Summarizes what the system does and what makes it special and different from other related applications -->

*The problem*: UH Manoa has over 200 Registered Independent Organizations, plus many more that do not have this “official” status but are nonetheless active organizations. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for students to learn what student clubs (both registered and unregistered) exist, what they do, and how to get further involved.

*The solution*: The Club Finder Manoa application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, meeting times and locations, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.

Club Finder Manoa has three user roles, all of whom login with their UH ID:
  - Regular users browse the directory
  - Club Admins have the ability to edit the data associated with their club
  - Super Admins make sure site content is appropriate and grant “club admin” privileges to selected users

The site will allow a user to browse the list of clubs in alphabetical order as well as filter by interest. For example, “athletic” clubs, “art” clubs, “music” clubs, etc. A club can belong to multiple interest areas, making it easier for users to find.

Users can specify interest areas, and be notified when a new club is created matching that interest area (or an existing club adds that interest area).

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content, and create new categories of interests, capabilities, and goals.
